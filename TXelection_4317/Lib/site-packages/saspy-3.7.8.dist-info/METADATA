# A Python interface to MVA SAS
## Overview
This module provides interfaces between Python and SAS. This module enables a Python developer to create mixed Python/SAS workflows to leverage the
powers of both SAS and Python, by connecting a Python process to any of a variety of SAS deployments, where it will run SAS code. The SAS code is
generated by the SASPy object and methods or explicitly user written. Results from SAS are returned as text, HTML5 documents (via SAS ODS), or as
Pandas Data Frames. This module supports running analytics and returning the resulting graphics and result data to the Python process. It can convert
data representations between SAS Data Sets and Pandas Data Frames. 

This module has multiple access methods which allow it to connect to local or remote Linux SAS, IOM SAS on Windows, Linux (Including Grid Manager),
or MVS, and local PC SAS. It can run within various Notebooks platforms, or IDE's/UI's or in interactive line mode Python or in Python batch scripts. 

It is expected that the user community can, and will, contribute enhancements. 

# Prerequisites
- Python3.x or above
- SAS 9.4 or above
- SAS Viya 3 or above

# Connecting offering
- Linux SAS: local or remote, including Grid Manager
- Windows SAS: local or remote
- MVS SAS: remote
- Jupyter, Databricks and/or Zeppelin Notebooks
- Interactive Line mode, Python IDE's or other UI's
- Batch Python scripts

# Installation

This module can be installed via pip or Conda. This will pull down the latest PyPI package and install it.

    pip install saspy

However, if that's too easy, you can also download a specific release from
[SASpy project releases page](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/releases), or just clone
the repo and and instll from that. To install a given release, use the following, 
where the X.X.X is the release version you want.

    pip install https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/archive/vX.X.X.tar.gz
